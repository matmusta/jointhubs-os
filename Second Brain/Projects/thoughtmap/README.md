# ThoughtMap

> ← [Back to Projects](../README.md) · [Jointhubs OS](../../../README.md)

Integrated vector storage for personal thought data — daily logs, voice dictation, and working notes — with topic clustering and interactive 2D visualization.

## What It Does

1. **Extracts** raw text from Obsidian daily notes (Logs, Dziennik, ideation sections), root topic notes, jointhubs-os AI reviews, and Wispr Flow dictation transcripts
2. **Chunks** text with sentence-boundary-aware splitting, overlap, and semantic merge
3. **Embeds** chunks locally using `nomic-embed-text:v1.5` via Ollama (768 dims, multilingual en/pl)
4. **Clusters** using UMAP + HDBSCAN to find topic groups (god nodes, bridges)
5. **Visualizes** as an interactive 2D scatter plot with semantic and timeline views
6. **Reports** cluster summaries, topic density, and thought patterns over time

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Configure your data paths
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Obsidian vault path and Wispr Flow directory

# 2. Start everything
docker compose up --build

# 3. Open http://localhost:8585 in your browser
```

The app shows a loading page while the pipeline runs (~1-2 min on first start including model download), then automatically redirects to the interactive visualization.

## Privacy & Data

- **ThoughtMap runs locally by default**: embeddings, clustering, condensation, and entity summaries use Ollama on your machine
- **Repo notes stay on disk**: the pipeline reads local markdown, optional local Obsidian Vault files, and optional local Wispr Flow SQLite history
- **Copilot is separate from ThoughtMap**: using GitHub Copilot in VS Code can send context to cloud-hosted model providers, but running the ThoughtMap pipeline alone does not
- **Cloud embeddings are opt-in**: OpenAI and Google providers are available only if you explicitly configure API keys
- **UI network request**: the visualization currently loads `vis-network.js` from a CDN

## Architecture

```
docker compose up
  ├── thoughtmap-ollama     Ollama server (GPU-accelerated, serves nomic-embed-text)
  └── thoughtmap-app        Pipeline + web server at :8585
        │
        ├── Waits for Ollama, pulls model if needed
        ├── Extract → Chunk → Embed → Merge → Store → Cluster
        ├── Generates REPORT.md + thoughtmap.html + JSON artifacts
        └── Serves interactive visualization at /
```

## Output

Results land in `Second Brain/Operations/thoughtmap-out/`:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `thoughtmap.html` | Interactive 2D visualization (semantic + timeline views) |
| `REPORT.md` | Cluster summary, god nodes, source/category breakdown |
| `chunks.json` | All chunks with metadata for downstream use |
| `clusters.json` | Cluster definitions with labels and representative texts |

`thoughtmap.html` is the UI. Once it has been generated, you do not need Docker just to view it again.

## Viewing The UI

There are now two ways to open ThoughtMap:

### 1. Full pipeline + UI via Docker

Use this when you want fresh data:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Then open `http://localhost:8585`.

### 2. Static UI only

Use this when you only want to view the last generated output:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m thoughtmap static
```

Then open `http://localhost:8585/thoughtmap.html`.

You can also open the generated file directly from disk:

`Second Brain/Operations/thoughtmap-out/thoughtmap.html`

Static mode does not run extraction, embedding, clustering, or Docker. It only serves the already-generated files from the output folder.

## Configuration

All paths in `config.py` support environment variable overrides. Docker Compose sets them via `.env`:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `OBSIDIAN_VAULT` | Path to your Obsidian vault root |
| `WISPR_DB_DIR` | Directory containing `flow.sqlite` |
| `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` | Ollama API endpoint (auto-set in Docker) |
| `THOUGHTMAP_PORT` | Web server port (default: 8585) |

## Scheduled Automation

ThoughtMap can run automatically every night via Windows Task Scheduler.

### Install the schedule

Run once as Administrator from the repo root:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ".github\automation\install-schedules.ps1"
```

### Check schedule status

```powershell
Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName "jointhubs-ThoughtMap" | Format-Table TaskName, State
```

### Run manually (outside schedule)

```powershell
Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName "jointhubs-ThoughtMap"
```

### Stop / disable the schedule

```powershell
# Disable (keeps the task, stops it from running)
Disable-ScheduledTask -TaskName "jointhubs-ThoughtMap"

# Re-enable later
Enable-ScheduledTask -TaskName "jointhubs-ThoughtMap"

# Remove entirely
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ".github\automation\uninstall-schedules.ps1"
```

### Logs

Runs are logged to `Second Brain/Operations/automation-logs/thoughtmap-*.log` (last 30 kept).

See [.github/automation/README.md](../../../.github/automation/README.md) for full details including the weekly graphify schedule.

## CLI Mode

Run the pipeline without the web server:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m thoughtmap       # CLI mode
python -m thoughtmap server  # Web server mode
python -m thoughtmap static  # Serve existing UI only
```
