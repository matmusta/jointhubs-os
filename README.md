> **Your AI-powered Second Brain.** A multi-agent VS Code Copilot system built on Obsidian.

Fork it. Personalize it. Let AI agents that actually *know you* handle the grind: planning your week, reviewing your code, journaling your progress, managing your projects.

**Your brain works differently. Your AI assistant should too.**

It is already useful before the system is "finished". Even in its current state, the stack can turn daily notes, reviews, and voice transcripts into a working planning surface: recurring reviews, entity tracking, project memory, and a map of what keeps showing up across your week.

## Why Jointhubs OS?

Most AI tools give you a blank chat window and wish you luck. Jointhubs OS gives you a **team of specialized agents** that read your notes, understand your projects, and remember what happened yesterday.

This is a **starter kit**, not a finished product. The agents, skills, prompts, and vault structure are all designed to be changed. Delete what you don't need, add what you do, reshape it around how *you* think and work.

- **7 agents**, each with a distinct personality and purpose
- **8 skills** with domain knowledge agents load when needed
- **13 prompts** for daily kickoff, commits, reviews, and more
- **Directory-scoped instructions** that apply automatically based on what you're working on
- **MCP integrations** to connect Google Workspace, web search, and other tools
- **100% yours**: fork, customize, extend. Your notes stay local, your AI stays personal

Agents maintain continuity through **daily logs**. They read yesterday's notes, pick up context, and keep working where you left off.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Fork & clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/jointhubs-os.git
cd jointhubs-os

# 2. Open as an Obsidian vault (the repo IS your vault)

# 3. Configure MCP (optional)
cp .vscode/mcp.json.example .vscode/mcp.json
# Add your credentials to .vscode/mcp.json

# 4. Open in VS Code → Copilot Chat → Pick an agent → Go
```

## Agents

Specialized personas you select in Copilot Chat. Each brings a different mindset to your work.

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Tech Lead** | Code, architecture, system design, debugging |
| **Planner** | Daily/weekly planning, prioritization, focus sessions |
| **Journal** | Reflection, pattern recognition, knowledge synthesis |
| **Designer** | UX review, accessibility, interface critique |
| **Debug** | Systematic bug investigation and resolution |
| **Investor** | Stock research, due diligence, scenario modeling |
| **Travel Planner** | Trip planning, accommodation research, itineraries |

Create your own: copy `_TEMPLATE.agent.md` → customize → done.

## Skills

Domain knowledge that agents load automatically when relevant.

| Skill | What It Teaches |
|-------|-----------------|
| **daily-log** | Daily note format, session continuity |
| **weekly-review** | Weekly reflection and planning process |
| **obsidian-vault** | Vault structure, naming, frontmatter, tags |
| **project-context** | Project lifecycle with `CONTEXT.md` pattern |
| **strategic-thinking** | Decision frameworks, trade-offs, scenarios |
| **design-review** | Design checklists, accessibility standards |
| **travel-research** | Accommodation, flights, travel deal strategies |
| **agentic-engineering** | Building agents, skills, and prompts |

## Prompts

One-command workflows. Type `/prompt-name` in Copilot Chat.

### What Goes Where

| Layer | Path | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Agents** | `.github/agents/*.agent.md` | Who does the work: personalities and tool access |
| **Skills** | `.github/skills/*/SKILL.md` | What they know: domain knowledge loaded on demand |
| **Prompts** | `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md` | Repeatable workflows triggered with `/name` |
| **Instructions** | `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` | Rules auto-applied by file path |
| **Notes** | `Second Brain/` | Your notes, read and written by agents for context |

## Public-Safe Fork Workflow

If you want to use this repo as your own operating system and still contribute upstream, keep a hard boundary between `shared framework` and `personal operating data`.

**Safe to commit upstream:**
- framework code, docs, templates, shared prompts, shared agents, shared skills
- generic examples that do not reference real people, private projects, or local machine paths

**Keep local only:**
- personal notes and journals
- communication logs, daily execution boards, generated reviews, and ThoughtMap output built from your own notes
- machine-specific prompts, instructions, and experiments in `.github/*/local/`

Recommended flow:

1. Commit only public-safe files to your fork.
2. Push your branch or `main` to `origin`.
3. Open a Pull Request from your fork into `upstream`.
4. Keep personal workflows and note content in ignored paths or local-only prompt/instruction folders.

Before pushing, run a quick audit:

```bash
git status --short --ignored
git diff --cached
```

## Customization

This is **your** system. Customize everything.

### The Agent Contract

When you change your notes, update the agents so they can still find things:

| You Changed | Update This |
|-------------|-------------|
| Folder paths | `.github/skills/obsidian-vault/SKILL.md` |
| Daily log format | `.github/skills/daily-log/SKILL.md` |
| Project structure | `.github/skills/project-context/SKILL.md` |
| New conventions | `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` |

### Local / Private Configuration

Every customization layer has a `local/` subfolder for private files that won't be committed:

- `.github/agents/local/` - Private agents
- `.github/skills/local/` - Private skills
- `.github/prompts/local/` - Private prompts
- `.github/instructions/local/` - Private instructions
- `.vscode/mcp.json` - Your MCP credentials (gitignored)

If a workflow includes your real name, private contacts, or absolute file-system paths, treat it as local by default and move it under the matching `local/` folder before opening a PR.
