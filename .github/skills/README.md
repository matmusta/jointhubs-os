# Skills Directory

Agent Skills are folders of instructions and resources that AI agents load on-demand.

## Shared vs Local

- Shared skills that are safe to commit live in `.github/skills/{skill-name}/`
- Private or experimental skills should live in `.github/skills/local/{skill-name}/`
- `.github/skills/local/` is ignored by git, so you can keep personal playbooks and unstable skills there

## How Skills Work

Skills use **progressive disclosure**:

1. **Discovery** — Agent reads `name` and `description` from SKILL.md frontmatter
2. **Loading** — When relevant, full SKILL.md loads into context
3. **Resources** — Templates and scripts load only when referenced

This means many skills with minimal context cost.

## Skill Structure

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          # Required: metadata + instructions
├── template.md       # Optional: template
├── scripts/          # Optional: automation scripts
└── examples/         # Optional: example files
```

## Creating Skills

1. Decide whether the skill is `shared` or `local`
2. Create folder: `.github/skills/{skill-name}/` for shared skills, or `.github/skills/local/{skill-name}/` for private skills
3. Add `SKILL.md` with frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: |
  What this skill does.
  Use when: "trigger phrase 1", "trigger phrase 2".
---
```

4. Add instructions in the body
5. Add resources (templates, scripts) as needed
6. Update this README only for shared skills

## When To Keep A Skill Local

- The skill contains sensitive client or personal context
- The workflow is still changing quickly
- The skill is useful only for your local vault or machine

Promote it into the shared area only when the content is reusable and safe to publish.

## Templates

Skills can include templates as resources.

Templates live in the skill folder. If you use Obsidian Templater (or another system), copy the template into your own templates folder.
